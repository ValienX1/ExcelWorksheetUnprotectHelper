# ExcelWorksheetUnprotectHelper
Excel worksheet unprotect help and WPF/C# small practice
A small application that helps you unprotect an excel password protected worksheet.
I work a lot with excel and sometimes need to use passwords on worksheets. And as for passwords, sometimes I forget them.In older versions of excel, the password was easily cracked using VBA. In 365, the speed of brute force solutions is no longer satisfactory. So I decided to write a small application that will help me in this situation next time. I Used WPF solution a bit overkill for such a small task like opening an excel file and removing the sheet's protections, but it was a good exercise to learn a bit more about C# and XAML.
